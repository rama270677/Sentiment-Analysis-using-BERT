# Sentiment-Analysis-using-BERT
Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT

Preprocess and clean data for BERT Classification.
Load in pretrained BERT with custom output layer.
Train and evaluate finetuned BERT architecture on your own problem statement

In this project, you will learn how to analyze
a dataset for sentiment analysis. You will 
learn how to read in a PyTorch BERT model, and
adjust the architecture for multi-class 
classification. You will learn how to adjust 
an optimizer and scheduler for ideal training 
and performance. In fine-tuning this model, you 
will learn how to design a train and evaluate 
loop to monitor model performance as it trains, 
including saving and loading models. Finally, 
you will build a Sentiment Analysis model that
leverages BERT's large-scale language knowledge.

SKILLS YOU WILL DEVELOP:
Neuro-Linguistic Programming,
Deep Learning,
Machine Learning,
Sentiment Analysis,
BERT
